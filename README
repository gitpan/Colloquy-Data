NAME
    Colloquy::Data - Read Colloquy 1.3 and 1.4 data files

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dumper;
     use Colloquy::Data qw(:all);
     
 my $colloquy_datadir = "/home/system/colloquy/data";
     
 #my ($users_hashref,$lists_hashref) = users($colloquy_datadir);
     my ($lists_hashref,$users_hashref) = lists($colloquy_datadir);
     
 print "Users: ".Dumper($users);
     print "Lists: ".Dumper($lists);

DESCRIPTION
    This module munges the users.lua and lists.lua (Colloquy 1.3x) files in
    to executable perl code which is then evaluated. Colloquy 1.4 uses a
    seperate LUA file for each user and list, which are located in the users
    and lists directories in the Colloquy data directory. These files are
    read one by one and evaluated in the same way.

    This module compiles and execute the Colloquy data files in restricted
    compartments using the Safe module. Even so, this module should be used
    with caution if you cannot gaurentee the integrity of the user and list
    LUA files. The module will issue a warning complaining about world
    writable permissions if $^W warnings.

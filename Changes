Version 1.9 - 29th December 2005
    + Added Changes file.

    + Added GPL license header comment to various files.

    + Modified Makefile.PL to send anonymous information to
      http://perlgirl.org.uk/lib/usage.cgi if the user
      agrees. This is so I can track which of my modules
      are most heavily used and on what platforms, so I can
      concentrate on maintaning the most popular ones in
      my limited spare time.

Version 1.6 - 13th December 2005
    + Changed code to only read in files and ignore
      directories.

Version 1.5 - 8th December 2005
    + Changed POD.

Version 1.4 - 28th November 2005
    + Added condition to catch known invalid user data files
      in colloquy when only the "return {" line is written
      because of case sensitive cruft in the colloquy code.

Version 1.3 - 12th November 2005
    + Fixed typo.

Version 1.2 - 12th November 2005
    + Updated the code to include carping and to actually
      do the permissions checking ;-)

Version 1.1 - 12th November 2005
    + Adding initial release.
